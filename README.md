# RaspiCon
Raspberry Pi Connection - Its an Android Application written in Java to connect to the Remote Raspberry Pi Script

### Introduction
I started this Project over a Year ago. At the beginning it was just a script to stream some YouTube Videos on my TV. Later i added a WebRadio Stream and created this Android APP for it.

### Installation
Download: https://github.com/flatt3rn/raspicon/raw/master/RaspiCon.apk<br>
Change your Android Settings to install an Application from unknown sources<br>
Settings > Security > Unknown Sources

As well you need the Remote Raspberry Pi Script: https://github.com/flatt3rn/rrpi

### How Does it Work
After you installed the Application you have to connect to the Raspberry Pi.
The Standard IP is 192.168.1.101, if you want to change it hold the Volume Up Button for more that 3 Seconds. Then you can set there your IP
Now you can do the following things:

* Listen to different Radio Streams
* Stream YouTube Videos from the Official YouTube APP. Just share the Video to RaspiCon
* Stream from Different Web Pages. Just share from the Browser to RaspiCon
* Shutdown and Reboot the Raspberry Pi
* Browse Your Files and Stream them
* Stream DragonBall and OnePiece Videos
